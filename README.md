# Ancient Computer

![Sample of Ancient Computer](sample.svg)

Ancient Computer is a simple bitmap font inspired by old terminal displays and early pixel fonts on the web. It covers the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets, and is available for free under the Open Font License.

## Building

To build the font files from their sources, run `build.py`. This font requires Python 3, [FontTools](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools), and [Bits N' Picas](https://github.com/kreativekorp/bitsnpicas) (as a JAR located in the parent directory) to build.
